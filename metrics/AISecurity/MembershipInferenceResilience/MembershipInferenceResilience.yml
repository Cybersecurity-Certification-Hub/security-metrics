id: MembershipInferenceResilience
description: This rule assesses whether a [MachineLearningModel] has implemented privacy-preserving techniques that increase its resilience against membership inference attacks over the compliant level of [p1:membershipInferenceResilience].
category: AISecurity
version: "v1"
comments: Machine learning models should incorporate explicit privacy-preserving techniques (such as noise injection) to reduce the risk of membership inference attacks and protect whether individual data points were included in the training set.
