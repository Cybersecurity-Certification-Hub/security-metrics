  This rule assesses whether an [AIModel] has [LIMEExplanation] [p1:enabled]
  correctly configured to provide local interpretable explanations.
category: Explainability
version: "1.0"
comments: >
  LIME creates local interpretable explanations using linear surrogate models.
  It works by perturbing the input and observing changes in the output, thereby
  approximating the model's decision boundaries around the instance. This rule
  verifies that LIME explanation functionality is enabled.
