  This rule evaluates whether an [AIModel] has [ModelLeakageDetection] configured
  so that the final SHAPr leakage score for any training sample does not exceed
  the allowed risk threshold [p1:maxAllowedLeakage].

  We evaluate model privacy using SHAPr leakage metrics. The final SHAPr score
  for a training sample ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate higher
  membership privacy risk. This rule is compliant only if all samples stay
  below the configured maximum SHAPr leakage threshold.
