description: This rule assesses whether a [MachineLearningModel] has the compliant level of [p1:evasionEfficacyLevel].
category: AISecurity
version: "v1"
comments: Evasion attacks manipulate input data to deceive AI models, leading to incorrect predictions or classifications. The attack strength should be iteratively increased to a limit of 50% and then, the measured attack efficacy is reported. The lower the result of the EvasionAttackEfficacy, the better.
