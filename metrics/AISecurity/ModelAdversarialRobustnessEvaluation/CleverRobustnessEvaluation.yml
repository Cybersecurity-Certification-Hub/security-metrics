  This rule evaluates whether an [AIModel] has sufficient adversarial robustness
  by ensuring that the CLEVER robustness score remains above the minimum
  acceptable threshold [p1:minAllowedCleverScore].
category: AdversarialRobustness
version: "1.0"
comments: >
  CLEVER scores assess the robustness of a model against adversarial examples.
  A higher CLEVER score generally indicates better robustness, as the smallest
  hostile disturbance needs a larger Lp norm. The value range depends on the
  radius size (0–5 by default, configurable in toolbox/compute_untargeted_clever()).
  This rule is compliant only if the CLEVER score meets or exceeds the configured
  minimum robustness threshold.
