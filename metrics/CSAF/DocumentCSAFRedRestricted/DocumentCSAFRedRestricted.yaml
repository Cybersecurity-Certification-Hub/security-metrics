description: This rule assesses whether a [SecurityAdvisoryDocument] that provides the property [RemoteDocumentLocation] is access protected by ensuring that the [p1:noAuthentication] property is not utilized.
version: "1.0" 
comments: A SecurityAdvisoryDocument labeled as "AMBER" or "RED" must be protected by access controls. The Rego policy verifies that the noAuthentication property is not set; it performs this check directly in the policy and does not rely on configuration properties. The specification can be found at https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/os/csaf-v2.0-os.html#715-requirement-5-tlpamber-and-tlpred.
