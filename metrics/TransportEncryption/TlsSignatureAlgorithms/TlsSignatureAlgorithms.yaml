description: This rule assesses whether a [Resource] has its [TransportEncryption] [p1:tlsSignatureAlgorithm] correctly configured.
version: "1.0"
comments: Using secure TLS signature algorithms (e.g., ECDSA or RSA and SHA-256 or SHA-512) ensures the authenticity and integrity of the communication, protecting against forgery and tampering.
