id: T2CoherenceTime
description: This rule assesses whether a [QPU] has a [p1:T2CoherenceTime] that is above a specified threshold.
category: QuantumSecurity
version: "v1" 
comments: T1 and T2 coherence times are a standard measure for the reliability of executing quantum circuits. T2 is the qubits' dephasing time (in seconds). It measures the time for a qubit to lose the phase coherence of its superposition state.
