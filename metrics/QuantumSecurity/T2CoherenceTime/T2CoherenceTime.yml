id: T2CoherenceTime
description: This rule assesses whether a [QPU] has a [T2CoherenceTime] that is above a specified [p1:time] threshold.
category: QuantumSecurity
version: "1.0" 
comments: T1 and T2 coherence times are a standard measure for the reliability of executing quantum circuits. T2 is the qubits's dephasing time (in seconds). It measures the time for a qubit to lose the phase coherence of its superopsition state.
