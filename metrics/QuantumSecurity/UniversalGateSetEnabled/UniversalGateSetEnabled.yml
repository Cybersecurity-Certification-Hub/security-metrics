description: This rule assesses whether a [QPU] has [p1:UniversalGateSetEnabled] correctly configured.
category: QuantumSecurity
version: "1.0" 
comments: The physical operations shall include a finite set of gates capable of approximating any unitary operation on qubits. This is typically achieved through combinations of one-qubit gates and a two-qubit entangling gate, such as CNOT, enabling the execution of a broad range of quantum algorithms.
