id: RegistryNotaryEnabled
description: This rule checks whether a [ContainerRegistry] exposes the property [p1:contentTrustEnabled] indicating that Notary content trust is enforced for image pulls and pushes.
category: SupplyChainManagement
version: "1.0"
comments: Container registries should enable content trust so signed images are required; the ontology still needs a [ContentTrust] security feature on [ContainerRegistry] (e.g., `contentTrustEnabled`) so evidence collectors can emit the flag to back this metric.
