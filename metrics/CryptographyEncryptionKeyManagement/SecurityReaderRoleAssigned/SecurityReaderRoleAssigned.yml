# ====== Metadata ======
id: SecurityReaderRoleAssigned
description: This rule checks that a [RoleAssignment] responsible for cryptographic oversight exposes the property [p1:securityReaderRoleAssigned], confirming at least one [Identity] is in place to monitor key usage, audit access, and respond to issues.
category: CryptographyEncryptionKeyManagement
version: "1.0" 
comments: Leaving the security reader unassigned creates blind spots in monitoring key vault usage, reviewing cryptographic logs, and escalating incidents; this metric validates that the responsibility has at least one active identity.
