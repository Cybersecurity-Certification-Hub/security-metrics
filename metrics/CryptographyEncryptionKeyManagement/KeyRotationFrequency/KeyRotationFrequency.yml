id: KeyRotationFrequency
description: This rule evaluates whether a [KeyManagementProcess] exposes the property [p1:keyRotationFrequency] measuring the number of days between rotations, ensuring cryptographic keys are renewed within the defined cryptoperiod.
category: CryptographyEncryptionKeyManagement
version: "1.0"
comments: Extended key lifetimes increase exposure to compromise and regulatory violations; the metric confirms that key rotation completes within the allowed number of days so risk remains bounded.
