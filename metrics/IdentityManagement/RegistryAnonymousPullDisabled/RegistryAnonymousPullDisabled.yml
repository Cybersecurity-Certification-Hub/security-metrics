# ====== Metadata ======
id: RegistryAnonymousPullDisabled
description: This rule checks that a [ContainerRegistry] exposes the property [p1:anonymousPullDisabled], ensuring anonymous image pulls require authentication.
category: IdentityManagement
version: "1.0"
comments: Container registries should require authenticated pulls to apply IAM policies; the ontology should surface an [AnonymousPullDisabled] (or equivalent) feature on [ContainerRegistry], e.g., `containerRegistry.anonymousPullDisabled`, so evidence collectors can report it.
