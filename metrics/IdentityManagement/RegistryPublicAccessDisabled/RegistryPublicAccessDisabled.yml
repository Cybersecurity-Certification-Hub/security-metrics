# ====== Metadata ======
id: RegistryPublicAccessDisabled
description: This rule checks that a [ContainerRegistry] exposes the property [p1:publicAccessDisabled], ensuring external anonymous pulls are blocked and the registry remains private.
category: IdentityManagement
version: "1.0"
comments: Container registries should disable public access so identity controls apply; the ontology may need a [PublicAccessDisabled] (or equivalent) feature on [ContainerRegistry] mapped to `containerRegistry.publicAccessDisabled` reported by evidence collectors.
# ====== Configuration ======
