description: This rule assesses whether a [VirtualMachine] that offers the property [AutomaticUpdates], has [p1:interval] configured correctly.
category: EndpointSecurity
version: "v1" 
comments: Resources like virtual machines often offer a simple configuration that automatically installs updates, e.g. critical security updates. The interval which is set to check for such updates should be capped by a sensible maximum value.
