## New Ontology Pull Request

To propose new Ontology elements, please make sure to **check off each box** below:

- [ ] I have created an explanatory `rdfs:comment` and `"rdfs:label"` as `AnnotationAssertion` for each new class and property.
- [ ] I have read the documentation for the [Ontology](ontology/README.md).
- [ ] I have verified that the Ontology is correctly loaded into the tool Protégé without any errors after the changes.
- [ ] I have added a reviewer (e.g., @immqu).
